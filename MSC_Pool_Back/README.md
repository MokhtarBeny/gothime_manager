## üí° Design Thinking
Our approach to developing the Gotham City Time Manager is deeply rooted in design thinking, focusing on user recommendations and feedback. We actively listen to our users and implement features based on their needs and suggestions. This user-centric approach has led to several impactful enhancements in our application.

#### Team Dashboard
One significant addition, inspired by manager feedback, is the Team Dashboard. It allows managers to effectively oversee and manage their teams. This feature includes tools for scheduling, monitoring work hours, and managing team tasks, all designed to streamline the managerial process.

#### User-Friendly Shortcuts
Understanding that some of our users may face challenges in using computers, we've introduced easy-to-use shortcuts. These shortcuts enable users to clock in and out effortlessly, simplifying their daily interactions with the application. This feature is part of our commitment to making the Gotham City Time Manager accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

This iterative and responsive approach ensures that our application not only meets but exceeds the expectations and needs of our users, continuously evolving based on their valuable input.

## üîê Authentication and User Roles
Our application implements a robust authentication system that caters to four distinct user roles: Admin, General Manager (SManager), Manager, and User. Each role is designed with specific permissions and access levels to ensure efficient and secure operation.

### User Roles
- **Admin**: Has the highest level of access, with the ability to perform any action and inspect all aspects of the application.
- **General Manager (SManager)**: Assists the Admin by monitoring teams and users. They have extensive, but not complete, access to functionalities available to the Admin.
- **Manager**: Focused on team management. Managers can oversee their team's schedules, tasks, and performance.
- **User**: Primarily interacts with clock-in and clock-out functionalities, managing their own work hours.
